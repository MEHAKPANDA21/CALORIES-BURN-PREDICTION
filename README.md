Overview of the Project


You have developed a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity. You sourced the dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on various physiological factors. The model was built using XGBRegressor, a powerful gradient-boosting technique known for handling complex datasets efficiently.
Dataset Details


The dataset consists of 15,000 observations and features the following attributes:
- Gender (Categorical: Male/Female)
- Age (Integer)
- Height (Float)
- Weight (Float)
- Duration of activity (Float)
- Heart Rate during exercise (Float)
- Body Temperature (Float)
- Calories burned (Target variable, Float)
Libraries Used

Your implementation relies on several key Python libraries:
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Pandas: Handling data structures and preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing, train-test split, and evaluation
- XGBoost: Model training and optimization
Model Training


You employed XGBRegressor, which leverages gradient boosting for regression tasks. This model is particularly effective due to:
- Handling non-linearity and feature interactions
- Avoiding overfitting with regularization
- Efficiently learning patterns in structured data
Prediction Mechanism


The model takes input features like gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature to predict the number of calories burned. By analyzing patterns within these variables, the model learns how different physiological characteristics influence calorie expenditure.
Potential Enhancements
To further improve the accuracy:
- Feature Engineering: Adding BMI or activity type
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing parameters using GridSearchCV
- Ensemble Learning: Combining XGBoost with other models
- Deploying Model: Converting predictions into a real-world application using Flask or Streamlit
